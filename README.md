ask- Predicting a Startups Profit/Success Rate using Multiple Linear Regression in Python
Here 50 startups dataset containing 5 columns  like “R&D Spend”, “Administration”, “Marketing Spend”, “State”, “Profit”.

In this dataset first 3 columns provides you spending on Research , 
Administration and Marketing respectively. State indicates startup based on that state.
Profit indicates how much profits earned by a startup.

Clearly, we can understand that it is a multiple linear regression problem, as the independent variables are more than one.

Prepare a prediction model for profit of 50_Startups data in Py
